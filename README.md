# Supplementary Materials for the "*Design and Analysis of a Single-Camera Omnistereo Sensor for Quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs)*" 

The following iPython Notebooks reproce the analysis plots performed over the *Theoretical Model* for the catadioptric omnidirectional stereo sensor proposed in the corresponding [Sensors Article](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/2/217/) published in February 6, 2016.
